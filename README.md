### What's this repository for? ###

This repository contains the problem and solution to the camper initiation challenge. 

### What's inside? ###

On the face of it, there are a number of files. But the main application and dependancies sit in the root folder along with the /engine python module. Find a more detailed analysis of the application below.
The 'data science' folder contains ipython notebooks and python script files that have been used to do data science. This includes things such as pre-processing, wrangling, EDA and modelling.

### How do I get set up? ###

This application is written in python 3.5.2 I have purposefully chosen not to write a setup.bat file as to avoid generating unecessary environments. 
But if you would like to do so, following are the dependancies that you will need.
